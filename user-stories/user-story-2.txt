  a) Description:
    - An administrator can click on the "Add Shape" button and add a new shape to the draw space.
    - An administrator can click on the "Remove Shape" button and remove an existing shape from the draw space.

    - Add a "Add Shape" button to the graphical layout.
    - Add a "Remove Shape" button to the graphical layout.
    - Ensure the "Add Shape" and "Remove Shape" buttons only respond to administrators who are logged in.
    - Display an "Add Shape" form to the administrator when clicked that allows the administrator to specify the
      properties of the new shape to be added to the draw space.
    - Upon submission of the "Add Shape" form, the new shape is written to the program's shape file and the draw
      space is re-loaded to display the new shape.
    - Display a "Remove Shape" form to the administrator when clicked that allows the administrator to select an
      existing shape and remove it from the draw space.
