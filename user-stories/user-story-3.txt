    - Display a "Modify Shape" form when clicked that allows the administrator to select an existing shape and
      modify it's properties.
    - Upon submission of the "Modify Shape" form, the program's shape file's entry for the selected shape is
      updated with the specified properties, and the draw space is re-loaded and displays the updated shape.
