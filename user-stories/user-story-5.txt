#5 As a user, I can add a testimonial.
  a) Description:
    - Users can write their own testimonials, up to a maximum character limit, and submit
      them to be displayed in the program immediately.
    - Users can see their own testimonial persist through multiple sessions of the
      programm running.
  b) Tasks:
    - Add an input area in the testimonial area where users can input their own text up to
      a character limit.
    - Add a submission button that is disabled until the user has entered at least one
      character in the testimonial input area.
    - Upon clicking the submission button, the user's testimonial should be written to the
      program's testimonial file, and the testimonial area should display the user's
      testimonial.
    - Users should only be able to add one testimonial per session.
  c) Tests:
    - Verify the user cannot submit a new testimonial unless they have input at least one
      character in the testimonial input field.
    - Verify the user's testimonial cannot exceed a to-be-determined character limit
      (if feasible).
